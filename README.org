* Worlds
Worlds is a simple platform game we are developing in our free time.

* Dependencies
You need to have the following libraries and programs installed in order to compile Worlds:
- irrlicht
- bullet
- cmake

* Compilation
: $ cmake .
: $ make

* Running:
You can launch the game by running
: $ ./bin/worlds
Because of some dependencies (data file stored in the ./media folder) it only works if you launch it from the root of the project.
You can move using the arrow keys, the spacebar and the mouse.

Enjoy!
